			<Text>Stave churches were wooden, post-and-beam constructions found throughout medieval Scandinavia after the Vikings converted to Christianity.  In Sweden alone it is estimated that over 1000 stave churches were built, the oldest dating back to the mid-1100s. Besides their religious function, stave churches often served as meeting halls, cultural centers, courthouses, and even as marketplaces. Early stave churches were palisade constructions, with steeply pitched roofs to shed the heavy snows. The churches had elaborate wooden carvings, usually Christian in design but occasionally depicting pre-Christian heroes and myths. Later, only the corner posts were set in the earth, with planking covering the frame. Currently 30 stave churches remain standing, all save two in Norway.</Text>

			<Text>On the shores of Lake Titicaca are the remains of one of the most powerful and influential cultures to appear in the Andean mountains: Tiwanaku. Long before the Incan Empire, the priests and nobles of Tiwanaku cultivated a hegemony over modern day Bolivia and northern Chile, based solely on cultural and religious influence. Within Tiwanaku was a sprawling complex of temples and courtyards for various rituals and rites, but the greatest of them all was the Akapana, a gargantuan manmade stepped pyramid in the shape of a modified Andean Cross.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Akapana's resemblance to the nearby mountains was not an accident, just as the mountains surrounding Lake Titicaca feed the great lake with their spring water, the Akapana is believed to have collected rainwater on its flat upper surface and funneled it into a depression at the centre. The centre of the pyramid contained a hole, filled with loose stones, which permitted water to drain out of the Akapana's center, and down into a moat surrounding the temple complex. Thus, the Akapana would have been seen as a holy mountain in its own right, blessing the city with its water. The act of pouring and collecting water and sacred drinks was central to many Andean religions, which presented gifts to the earth by pouring out drinks or burying meals and trinkets.</Text>
