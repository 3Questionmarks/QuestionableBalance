			<Text>The Fighter is a moderately-powerful air unit. It can be based in any city you own or aboard an aircraft carrier. It can move from city to city (or carrier) and can perform "missions" within its range of 10 tiles. Use fighters to attack enemy aircraft and ground units, to scout enemy positions, and to defend against enemy air attacks. Fighters are especially effective against enemy helicopters. See the rules on Aircraft for more information.</Text>
