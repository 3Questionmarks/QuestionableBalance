			<Text>A Broadcast Tower is a late-game Building which increases [ICON_CULTURE] Culture output of the city by 10%. Placing a broadcast tower atop a mountain will increase the functional range and therefore the [ICON_CULTURE] Culture yield of said mountain. The City must possess a Opera House (or a unique Building which replaces the Opera House) before it can construct a Broadcast Tower.</Text>
