			<Text>Unlike the Trebuchet it replaces, The Siege Tower is a melee siege unit unique to the Assyrians. It is more powerful than the Trebuchet, but the Siege Tower must move next to an enemy city to be effective, but once it has, it is devastating. It not only has a powerful city attack of its own, but also confers a bonus to any of your nearby units also attacking the city. Complement a Siege Tower with melee or ranged units, and make sure it reaches its target before getting killed, and cities will fall much more quickly. However it can only move 1 tile a turn.</Text>
