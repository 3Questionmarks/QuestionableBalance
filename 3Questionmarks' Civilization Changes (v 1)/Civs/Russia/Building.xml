				 <Text>The Krepost is the Russian unique building, replacing the barracks. The Krepost provides 15 experience points for all military units constructed in its city. In addition, the Krepost provides +1 [ICON_CULTURE] Culture from Tundra and Snow tiles, and increases the city's cultural border growth by 25%. It's quite worthwhile to construct these useful buildings in all Russian cities, but especially in cities on the civilization's frontiers.</Text>
