			<Text>May the blessings of God be upon you, oh righteous Caliph Umar! Revered by the Sunni faithful as a paragon of islamic virtues, under your wise leadership the Arabian Caliphate expanded at an unprecedented rate, completely conquering Sassanid Persia in less than two years and submitting two thirds of the Byzantine Empire to islamic rule, including the rich provinces of Egypt and Syria, as well as the holy city of Jerusalem. A gifted orator and administrator, you are hailed as the architect of the Islamic Empire, a brilliant reformist and a humble man of the people, establishing the first Welfare State of the world and also saving Arabia from famine.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rigtheous Umar, who distinguishes between right and wrong, the mantle of the Caliphate has once again fallen upon your shoulders. Can you lead your people back into the righteous path you follow? Can you build an empire that will stand the test of time?</Text>

			<Text>All from Al-Andalus to Samarkand await your guidance, great ruler Abd al-Malik of the Umayyad Dynasty. Driven by the religious duty of Jihad, the Umayyads ruled the largest state the world had yet seen, stretching from the Atlantic coast of Spain and North Africa to the borders of India. An able administrator compared to the great Rashidun Caliph Umar, under your reign Arabic finally became the official language of the government, new coins were issued, the postal service was expanded and served as an intelligence network and the Dome of the Rock was built in the holy city of Jerusalem.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mighty deputy of God, this colossal Caliphate would eventually come to fragment into several petty and warring states and forever break the unity of the Dar al-Islam; but your people proudly remember the days in which all of the faithful, from Spain to Persia, were united under the banner of the Umayyads. Can you reclaim these lands in the name of your dynasty, and then lead your armies into many more? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?</Text>

				The Umayyads were a merchant family based in Mecca. They had converted to Islam in 627, becoming prominent supporters of Mohammed and his successors. The early Umayyad caliphs were based in Damascus, Syria, and the Syrian army formed the backbone of the Arab military forces. The Umayyads expanded Arabian power east, building outposts and sending expeditions into Central Asia and northwestern India. In addition the Umayyads launched the invasion of North Africa. In the 7th century they constructed a Mediterranean fleet with which they launched a series of unsuccessful raids against Christian Constantinople.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Umayyad Caliphate reached its zenith under the reign of Abd al-Malik (reigned 685-705). In the west, Abd's armies overran much of Spain, while in the east the Caliphate invaded Sind in India and conquered Bukhara, Samarkand, Khwarezm, and many more places too hard to spell. al-Malik also oversaw a reorganization of the Caliphate's bureaucracy, economy, and the institution of a post service. During his reign the arts flourished, particularly architecture.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The empire suffered a decline after Abd al-Malik's death. A series of mediocre caliphs combined with economic troubles and military reverses in the east and west fueled tribal rivalries within the Caliphate, and in 750 the Umayyads were defeated and overthrown at the Battle of the Great Zab River.

			<Text>The Umayyads were defeated by the Abbasids, another powerful family. The first Abbasid Caliph, Abu al-Abbas, was a ruthless leader who upon achieving power immediately set about exterminating anyone else who might have a legitimate claim upon the throne. He was successful, as the Abbasids would remain in power for another three centuries. Not without a certain grim panache, he gave himself the name as-Saffah, which translates as "the bloodletter."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Abbasids shifted the capital of the Caliphate to Baghdad. This reflected its concentration on events in the east - Persia, India, Central Asia - and subsequent de-emphasis on North Africa and the Mediterranean. The Abbasids were more overtly religious than the Umayyads, and under them the Caliphate more closely followed Islamic law.</Text>

			<Text>Harun al-Rashid (reigned 786-809) was the fifth Abbasid caliph. He ruled Arabia at the height of its wealth and power. In his early years Harun led military expeditions against the Byzantine Empire; his successes earned him the nickname al-Rashid, "the one following the correct path." While Rashid did have to put down a number of internal revolts, the empire was mostly at peace during his reign, and the Caliphate grew monumentally, spectacularly wealthy. For more details on Harun al-Rashid, see his Civilopedia entry.</Text>

			<Text>The Arab empire of the medieval period was far more advanced than contemporary Europeans; Harun al-Rashid's Baghdad may have held a million people at the same time that Charlemagne's Aachen was a "capital" of ten thousand. Centers of learning attracted scholars from across the Muslim world to great cities such as Baghdad, Damascus, and Cordoba. The Arabs of this period made many advances in medicine, astronomy, mathematics, and other areas, as well as translating many of the classics of the Ancient Greeks into Arabic, thereby saving them from destruction.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the period of the Crusades, Christian Europe began a sustained assault against the Arabic world. The greatest of Muslim generals from this period was Salah al-Din, better known as Saladin, who successfully defeated the Third Crusade and recaptured Jerusalem for the Arabs.</Text>

			<Text>As the Middle Ages ended, however, the Empire began to fragment under increasing pressure from both external and internal forces. The sheer size of the Empire made centralized government nearly impossible, and the caliphs were forced to put down numerous insurrections by rebellious local leaders. The debate over the rightful heirs to Mohammed's leadership continued to fester. In the west the Europeans wrested control of Spain from the caliphate, while in the east the Seljuks began their inexorable expansion into the heart of the Arabian Empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1258 a Mongol army under Hulagu Khan captured Baghdad and executed Caliph al-Musta'sim, bringing the Arabian Empire to an abrupt end.</Text>

			<Text>Umar was one of the most powerful and influential Muslim caliphs in history. He was a senior Sahabi of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, succeededing Abu Bakr as the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate on 23 August 634. He was an expert Islamic jurist known for his pious and just nature, which earned him the epithet Al-Farooq ("the one who distinguishes (between right and wrong)"). Under Umar, the caliphate expanded at an unprecedented rate, ruling the Sassanid Empire and more than two-thirds of the Byzantine Empire. His attacks against the Sassanid Empire resulted in the conquest of Persia in less than two years (642–644). Umar is revered in the Sunni tradition as a great ruler and paragon of Islamic virtues, and some hadiths identify him as the second greatest of the Sahaba after Abu Bakr.</Text>

			<Text>Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan was the 5th Umayyad caliph, and was a well-educated man and capable ruler who was able to solve many political problems that impeded his rule. The 14th-century Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun stated that "`Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan is one of the greatest Arab and Muslim Caliphs. He followed in the footsteps of `Umar ibn al-Khattab, the Commander of the Believers, in regulating state affairs". During his reign, all important records were translated into Arabic, and for the first time, a special currency for the Muslim world was minted, which led to war with the Byzantine Empire under Justinian II. The Byzantines were led by Leontios at the Battle of Sebastopolis in 692 in Asia Minor and were decisively defeated by al-Malik after the defection of a large contingent of Slavs. The Islamic currency was then made the only currency of exchange in the Muslim world. Also, many reforms happened in his time relating to agriculture and commerce. Al-Malik extended and consolidated Muslim rule, made Arabic the state language and organised a regular postal service. Abd al-Malik is known as the "Father of Kings": his four sons succeeded him as the caliph one after another.</Text>
